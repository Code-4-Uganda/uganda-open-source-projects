## Contributing guidelines

For a project to be added, the following must be passed:

- The project must be open source.

- The project must have global use - meaning it's not made just for use by Ugandans and no geographical limitation for anyone that may be interested in using this project.

- The project should be starred. This is to serve as a way to determine that people actually have a use for the project and it does what it says it does. [ Stars likely to go up as time goes on :smiley: ].

- The project should not be a list of some sort.

- Ensure to provide a social media url of the creator of the project outside GitHub.

- Please ensure that all the fields (authors_name, github_link, contact_info of the author) are filled when adding a new project
